    <h2 id="about"> About Me</h2>
    <p> 
        My name is Meke Finau. I am 29 years of age. I grew up in the beautiful island of Tonga. When I was in elementary school, I have always wanted to be a soldier. I love flying kites and playing marbles with all the kids in the neighborhood. The older I grow up, I dreamed of being a doctor to help save lives. 
        <br>
        As I moved here to the United Stades, my eyes were open. I could not even believe those opportunities I see every single day that I have never thought about. That's when I told myself that this is really the land of opportunities.
